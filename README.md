#node-backend-starter

Hi, GA.

## Local development

For local develoment, the app runs inside a Docker container. To build and start the container, simply run `make`.

Before pushing changes, please run `make test`.

I loosely follow the npm style guide, so if you're going to hack on this, kindly avail yourself of [its wisdom](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style). Loosely because I think leading commas look dumb.
